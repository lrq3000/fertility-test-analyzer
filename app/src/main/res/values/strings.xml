    <!-- Information Activity -->
    <string name="info_title_teststrips">Test Strips</string>
    <string name="info_teststrips">A test strip is a basic and inexpensive diagnostic tool which is used to determine hormonal changes in a person\'s
        urine. It has a chemical pad that reacts with the urine, changing color, when is immersed in during a certain period of time (usually
        a few seconds).\n\nSome test strips are used to predict when a woman is going to ovulate –Ovulation Tests– and others are used to
        determine if she is pregnant –Pregnancy Tests–.</string>
    <string name="info_title_ovulation">Ovulation Test Strips</string>
    <string name="info_ovulation1">Either if you are trying to get pregnant or are trying to prevent pregnancy, Ovulation Tests are very useful
        to find your fertile days. Unlike temperature charting, which tells when you have ovulated, these tests help you predict in advance the time of
        ovulation and peak fertility.\n\n
        Each month your body increases the production of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) halfway through the cycle
        which causes the releasing of an egg (ovulation). When the test shows a positive result, it means that ovulation will happen in
        the next three days. Pregnancy is technically only possible from five days before ovulation to the day of ovulation.</string>
    <string name="info_ovulation2">1. How do they work?\n\n
        The tests have two chemical pads: a test line to show qualitatively the LH present in your urine and a control line to show if
        the test has worked properly. This control line also gives the baseline color to interpret the test results. If the test line is the same
        intensity or darker than the test control band, it means that you will ovulate within the next days. When the test line color is lighter
        than the other line, it means that your body has not released its surge of LH.\n\n
        2. When is the best time of day to take the ovulation test?\n\n
        From 10am to early evening. This is because the LH is synthesized by your body in the early morning and will not appear in your urine until
        later in the day.\n\n
        3. Should I take the test at the same time every day?\n\n
        Yes, if you want to optimize results accuracy take the tests at the same time each day. It is also recommended to reduce your liquid intake
        around 2 hours before testing as a diluted urine sample can hinder detection of the LH surge.\n\n
        4. When is best to have sex in order to increase the chance of conceiving?\n\n
        It is recommended to time intercourse after a positive result, the day of the LH surge as well as the following three days after, 
        as this is the window of maximum fertility. However many doctors recommend to have sex once every two days during your cycle if you are
        trying for a baby, especially if you have irregular periods.\n\n
        5. Are there any other common signs or symptoms of ovulation?\n\n
        Yes, a Basal Body Thermal (BBT) shift is a very clear sign you\'ve ovulated. If you BBT chart daily, you\'ll be able to tell when the egg
        was released based on an increase in body temperature. However, it will become measurable the day after you ovulate. The ovulation
        cramping or midcycle pains (mittelschmerz) that some women feel, signal the actual release of the egg. The abundance of fertile
        quality cervical mucus is another symptom, and it occurs just prior to your fertile window. Once you ovulate, rising levels of
        progesterone and decreasing estrogens will result in less cervical mucus, and the quality of mucus will deteriorate, becoming
        less fertile (sticky, opaque, white/yellowish, hold its shape). Finally, the location of the cervix can tell you if ovulation is near.
        As you approach ovulation, your cervix becomes soft, high, open and wet. After ovulation these signs reverse, and your cervix becomes
        firm, low, closed and dry.</string>
    <string name="info_title_pregnancy">Pregnancy Test Strips</string>
    <string name="info_pregnancy1">Like ovulation tests, pregnancy tests also work detecting the presence of a certain hormone in your urine.
        When a fertilized egg implants in your uterus lining, membranes surrounding the tiny embryo begin secreting Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin
        (HCG) into your blood. This hormone can be detected in your urine about 7 to 14 days after fertilization. HCG level peaks at the second
        month of pregnancy, then declines. Although low, this level remains steady until birth.</string>
    <string name="info_pregnancy2">Some pregnancy tests are sensitive enough to pick up a trace of HCG before your period is due. You will see
        that concentrations of HCG are reported in milli-International Units (mIU) per milliliter. A test with a sensitivity of 20 mIU/ml is more
        sensitive than one with a sensitivity of 50 mIU/ml.\n\n
        1. How do they work?\n\n
        These pregnancy tests have two chemical pads, a test line to show qualitatively the HCG present in your urine and a control line to show
        if the test worked properly. When the test line appears, even fade, it means that you are pregnant.\n\n
        2. When is the best time of day to take the pregnancy test?\n\n
        First morning urine is the best time to collect a sample for pregnancy tests.\n\n
        3. When can I get my first positive pregnancy test?\n\n
        20mIU/hCG tests offer increased sensitivity and a capacity to detect a positive result earlier. This means that you can begin testing
        at approximately 7 to 10 days past ovulation. Nevertheless, a negative within this time frame does not necessarily indicate you are
        not pregnant.</string>
    <string name="info_title_fta">Fertility Test Analyzer</string>
    <string name="info_fta1">Most of the time, it happens that test results are not clear and women find them difficult to read. It can be really
        frustrating not to have a certain answer especially if you have been trying to conceive for a long time. That is the reason why Fertility
        Test Analyzer app has been created.</string>
    <string name="info_fta2">Fertility Test Analyzer is an application that helps women like you to properly interpret the results of both ovulation and
        pregnancy tests. Using our own developed algorithm, the app recognizes the pigmentation trace present in the test pad and gives you your
        long awaited answer. But this is not the only feature of the app! You can also store your ovulation and/or pregnancy test results and see
        your body\'s evolution throughout a cycle or several cycles.\n\n
        It is really easy to use, helpful and convenient!\n\n
        Fertility Test Analyzer also helps you save money because now you can buy those cheap test strips and take tests everyday knowing that you will
        have reliable results once and for all.</string>

    <string name="help_good_pic_title">Good picture, accurate results!</string>
    <string name="help_good_pic1">Fertility Test Analyzer relies on the good quality of your photos to provide the best results. If the camera of
    your device does not have a good resolution or contrast, it is going to be difficult to take the most of our app features. </string>
    <string name="help_good_pic2">Take into account that both the resolution of your camera and a good lighting are critical to
    produce optimal images. We highly recommend you to lean your elbows on a surface and use day light when taking the photographs.</string>

    <string name="help_mask_title">How do I take a picture of a test strip?</string>
    <string name="help_mask1">Fertility Test Analyzer provides you with three different mask sizes that you can choose to take
    the photo. Select the one that suits you better and place the test strip inside the strip outline that appears in the screen. </string>
    <string name="help_mask2">It is important to place the test so the handle is on the right, the control line is in the rectangle and
         the test line is within the square brackets.</string>

    <string name="help_percentage_title">What does the percentage given by the app mean?</string>
    <string name="help_percentage_expl1">The app compares the pigmentation level of the test line versus the control line and gives
    a percentage. Thus, the percentage is the relative value of the test line pigmentation with respect to the control line pigmentation.
        For example:</string>
    <string name="help_percentage_expl2">0% -  means that the app has not detected any pigmentation of the test line.</string>
    <string name="help_percentage_expl3">40% - means that the pigmentation of the test line is 60% lighter than
    the pigmentation of the control line.</string>
    <string name="help_percentage_expl4">100% - means that the pigmentation of the test line is the same than the
    pigmentation of the control line.</string>
    <string name="help_percentage_expl5">120% - means that the pigmentation of the test line is 20% more intense
    than the pigmentation of the control line.</string>

    <string name="help_threshold_title">Why a threshold value for pregnancy tests?</string>
    <string name="help_threshold1">Fertility Test Analyzer establishes a threshold value (5% of pigmentation) to start considering a pregnancy
        test as positive.</string>
    <string name="help_threshold2">This is important to prevent measurement errors (inherent to all measurement techniques) from being considered
        as positive results. </string>

    <string name="help_brand_title">Should I use the same brand to compare tests?</string>
    <string name="help_brand">Yes, it is very important to use the same brand of ovulation or pregnancy tests to compare results in time.
    Brands tend to differ in pigmentation levels and results could not show consistency.</string>

    <string name="help_focus_title">How can I get my photos in-focus?</string>
    <string name="help_focus1">We highly recommend you to lean your elbows on a surface to stay steady, place the test on a white
         surface and use good lighting. The best light to use is the natural daylight (indirect sunlight is optimal) because it is diffuse and white, producing uniform illumination,
         without reflections and does not affect the test color.</string>
    <string name="help_focus2">Sometimes it is difficult to get photos in sharp focus. In these cases, you can touch the screen to ask the camera
        to focus on that area. By default the application uses the torch as a focus aid when it is necessary (the image is dark). This
        feature can be disabled in Settings. Once you focus manually, the camera keeps the best configuration it could find, and if then you move
        the test, you must touch the screen again to adjust the focus again.</string>
    <string name="help_focus3">If you still have problems framing the test strip in the mask so that it is in sharp focus, you have another tool:
        the zoom. Not all cameras support zooming. If your device does, you will see a slider on the screen that allows you to increase the size of the
        image. This increasing is usually done by software and, therefore, the captured image will have a little less quality, but it should not be
        a problem.</string>
    <string name="help_focus4">These tips rely on the light conditions, your test strips and your device, so you have to carry out several trials
        until you find the configuration that fits your case the best. In case you keep having difficulties, we provide three mask
        sizes selectable at the top of the camera screen. The smaller the width of the mask, the further you could focus and, therefore, the easier
        it should be to take a sharp image. Note that the smaller the test looks in the screen, the lesser the accuracy that the algorithm will have.</string>

    <string name="help_contrast_title">Why does it say low contrast in control line?</string>
    <string name="help_contrast">This means that you need more light to take a good picture. Try to get close to a window or turn on the torch
    using the torch icon at the top of the screen (only available if your device supports this feature).</string>

    <string name="help_qualitative_title">Transforming qualitative data into quantitative data. How accurate can that be?</string>
    <string name="help_qualitative">Test strips give results based on the pigmentation level of a small line, this is qualitative data by definition.
        They do not offer a numeric value to evaluate results, which often leads to interpretation problems.\n\n
        Fertility Test Analyzer offers a solution analyzing the pigmentation level, extracting the percentage value and giving its correct
        interpretation. However, the accuracy of the numeric value offered by the app is affected by a number of factors, i.e. test quality, how
        diluted the urine is, the quality of the camera used, your skills in taking a good picture (sharp and in-focus) and a correct lighting.
        Hence, numeric results obtained cannot be taken as exact values, only a laboratory can give those. That said, we normally get an
        accuracy better than 95% in our tests.\n\n
        Use at your own risk. Do not use to avoid pregnancy or anything where more accuracy would be required. Please consult your healthcare
        provider for any health concern.</string>
